<h2>Computational Logic Formula Solver</h2> 
<h3>Programmatically simplifies propositional/predicate logic formulas and proves their inconsistency</h3>

<br>
<b>Why is this useful?</b><br>
  Well, sometimes it is more efficient to use a computer in order to obtain CNF/DNFs for simplifying formulas using different methods of simplification in boolean algebra (Veitch, Karnaugh, Quine–McCluskey, Moisil's method, etc...).
<br><br>
<b>Who would be interested in such a tool?</b><br>
  Anyone who does not want to waste time simplifying formulas, especially students who have to "deal" with Computation Logic in college.
<br><br>
<b>What can it do so far?</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>solve implications such as p→q or (p→q)→(r→t)</li>
  <li>detect Conjunctive/Disjunctive Normal Forms, identifying their clauses/cubes, number of variables, unary and binary operations</li>
  <li>solve double negations using De Morgan's laws</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>What is next?</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>prove inconsistency of a formula using the Semantic Tableaux Method - graphical approach</li>
  <li>bring formulas to their simplest forms using boolean algebra graphical simplifications methods: Veitch and Karnaugh Diagrams</li>
</ul>
